# Aspect Oriented Programming


##	What is AOP

-	Enterprise application is divided into different segments or layers like

	-	UI Layer
	-	Integration
	-	Business Service Layer
	-	Data Access Layer
	
-	All these layers will have a cross cutting concerns like 
		
	-	Security
	-	Profiling
	-	Logging
	-	Transaction Management
	
-	These Cross Cutting concerns will be applicable for whole application across different modules
-	In OOP, Class is the key unit and Object represents the Class
-	In AOP, Aspect is key unit and Aspect is specialized class that addresses one or more Cross Cutting Concerns
	-	Aspects can be applied across the Objects and classes at runtime



## Why AOP

-	In an application, apart from writing the functional code we will write non-functional code better understandability, maintenance, debug, analysis
-	Some of the Non-functional requirements are:
	-	Security
	-	Logging
	-	Transaction Management
-	AOP helps to address some of these Non-functional concerns
-	These non-functional requirements are called as Cross-cutting concerns
-	AOP solves these Cross Cutting Concerns


## Libraries for Aspect Oriented Programming

-	Spring has its Aspect Programming implementation
-	Below are the two different libraries using which we can develop AOP
	-	Spring 
	-	AspectJ 


	
## Dependencies Required for Spring AOP Implementation

-	spring-aop-4.*.RELEASE.jar
-	spring-aspects-4.*.RELEASE.jar
-	aspectjweaver.-1.8.5jar	
	
## Spring AOP

-	Logging method name and parameter and what is the return type from the method
-	Aspect is non-functional concerns of the application
-	Aspects are applied at individual method level
-	AOP is supplement for OOP 
	-	AOP supports for OOP
-	


## Aspect Terminologies

-	Aspect: 
	-	What the functional that needs to apply at the JoinPoints
	-	EX: Logging, Security, Transaction Mngmnt
	-	Advice Types:
	
		-	Before Advice
		-	After returning Advice
		-	Around Advice
		-	Throws Advice
		
-	PointCut:	
	-	Expression that defines when, where that Aspect should be applied
	-	It's a expression that needs to met to apply the Aspect 
	
-	JoinPoint:
	-	JoinPoint defines what we need do done at runtime when PointCut is met
	-	JoinPoint defines the method with logic that needs to be executed when PointCut is met
	-	JoinPoint instance contains all the runtime information about the method call
	
-	Advice:
	-	Advice defines what needs to applied 
	-	Advice is a set of instructions in JoinPoint method that needs to performed when PointCut expression is met
	-	Advice denotes what is the statements that needs to be executed 
	-	What needs to be done

-	Weaver:
	-	Encapsulating all the process of Aspect Oriented programming is called Weaver	
	
	
	
## 	Advantages of Aspect Oriented Programming

-	We can define the Aspect at one common place and can be applied to all other places
-	Easy to manage and maintain 
-	Clean and neat coding in the actual method
-	Actual method doesn't even have the idea that there is a helper method on top of this method
-	Reduces redundancy
-	Reusability and Quick Development
-	Focus on one aspect
-	Enabled and disabled at runtime

	
	
	
## Terms of Aspect Oriented Programming

-	Aspect:
	-	An Aspect is a plain class that contains various advices and JoinPoints
	-	Aspect addresses one of the cross cutting concerns
	-	Aspects are applied across the 

-	Advice:
	-	An advice is a method that contains the set of instructions 
	-	Advice addresses a part of concerns

-	JoinPoint:
	-	JoinPoints is a point or place where advices needs to apply in a class
	-	Points can be method, field, constructor
	-	JoinPoints are the place where aspects needs to applied
	-	Spring Supports only method level JoinPoints
	-	JoinPoints  could be:
	
		-	Before
		-	After
		-	Around
		-	After Returning from Method
		-	After Throwing Exception
	
-	PointCut:
	-	PointCut is a expression language to match a particular JoinPoints


		@Aspect
		@Component
		public class SecurityAspect {
			
			@PointCut("execution (* myMethod(..))")
			public void applySecurityConcern(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
				// advice
			}
		
		}



## Sample implementation of Logging Cross Cutting Concern

	Code Snippet:
	
	
		@Component	
		public class HiBye {
		
			public void hi(String name) {
				System.out.println("Hi"+ name);
			}
			
			public void sayBye() {
				System.out.println("Bye");
			}
			
			public String returnSomething() {
				return "Hi Bye";
			}
		}
	
	
		@Aspect
		@Component
		public void HiByeAspectHelper {
		
			@Before("execution(* com.bharath.aop.HiByeService.*(..))")
			public void before(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
				System.out.print("Before");
				System.out.println(joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
				System.out.println(Arrays.toString(joinPoint.getArgs()));
			}
			
			@After("execution(* com.bharath.aop.HiByeService.*(..))")
			public void before(JoinPoint joinPoint) {
				System.out.print("After");
				System.out.println(joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
			}
			
			@AfterReturning(pointcut="execution(* com.bharath.aop.HiByeService.*(..))", returning = "result")
			public void before(JoinPoint joinPoint, Object result) {
				System.out.print("After");
				System.out.println(joinPoint.getSignature().getName());
				System.out.println("result" + result);
			}
			
		}
		
		
## 	Programming Techniques

-	Procedure Oriented Programming
-	Functional Programming
-	Structural Programming
-	Object Oriented Programming
-	Aspect Oriented Programming


-	Application Code is divided into two parts

	-	Primary Concern
		-	Business Logic
	-	Secondary Concern
		-	Non-functional Requirements
		
			-	Logging
			-	Auditing
			-	Security
			-	Transaction Management
			
	-	Adding Product
	-	Making Payment
	-	Managing Profile
		-	Are the Primary Concerns

		
-	AOP will support by adding solutions to common cross cutting concerns
-	In OOP, class the key unit of modularity
-	In AOP, aspect is the key unit of modularity
	

## AOP Weaving

-	In AOP Weaving, Primary Concern + Secondary Concern + Weaving = Target Object
-	Primary Concern will added with Secondary Concern to form the Proxy Object or Advised Object or Target Object
-	Source will be added with Aspects to form the Advised Object
-	Weaving can be done at compile time, load time, runtime

	Normal :
	
		source code -> Compiler -> Executable 
		
	
	Weaving	:
		
		Source Code + Aspect -> Weaver -> Advised Source Code -> Compiler -> Executable
	
## Enabling Aspect with Xml configuration

	Code Snippet:
	
		<aop:aspectj-autoproxy />
		 
		<context:component-scan base-package="com.howtodoinjava.demo.aop" />
	
##	What are the available AOP implementations?

-	AspectJ
-	Spring AOP
-	JBoss AOP	
	
	
## What are the different advice types in spring?

-	Before advice 
-	After advice
-	Around advice
-	After throwing advice
-	After returning advice


## What is Spring AOP Proxy?

-	A proxy is a well-used design pattern.
-	To put it simply, a proxy is an object that looks like another object, but adds special functionality behind the scene.
-	Spring AOP is proxy-based.
- 	AOP proxy is an object created by the AOP framework in order to implement the aspect contracts in runtime.
	
##	What is Weaving?

-	Weaving is a process of combining advices with actual code at compile, runtime, loading time

##	What is Join point and Point cut?

-	Pointcut:
	-	Pointcut is a expression that will be applied at specific Joinpoints
	-	Pointcut expression specifies where exactly 
	-	PointCut is a expression language to match a particular JoinPoints

-	Jointpoint:
	-	JoinPoints is a point or place where advices needs to apply in a class
	-	Points can be method, field, constructor
	-	JoinPoints are the place where aspects needs to applied
